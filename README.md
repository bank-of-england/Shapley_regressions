**"Shapley regressions: A framework for statistical inference on machine learning models"**

by Andreas Joseph (March 2019). 

The paper introduces a well-motivated and rigorous approach to address the black-box critique of machine learning models. Model interpretability is transferred to a multiple linear regression analysis - one of the most transparent and most widely used modelling techniques.

The output of machine learning models can now be presented as a regression table. The example below shows inference results for modelling changes in UK and US unemployment using quarterly macroeconomic time series. It compares several machine learning models (columns 1-3 for each country) with a linear regression (Reg column). As expected, all models learn similar variable dependencies, while machine learning models are generally more accurate (RMSE) and provide richer information, e.g. about non-linearity of the data generating process. Please see Table 4 in the paper for technical details.

Code structure
--------------

	- 1_macro_Shapley_regressions.py: UK and US macroeconomic time series analysis using 
		machine learning (ML) models and Shapley regressions for statistical inference (section 5.2 of paper).
	- 2a_ML_inference_simulation.py: Simulation of polynomial data-generating processes and
		ML inference based on Shapley decompositions and reconstruction
		(suited for parallel/cloud processing, section 5.1 of paper).
	- 2b_ML_inference_analysis.py: Collection of simulation results and graphical output (section 5.1 of paper). 
	- ML_inference_aux.py: Auxiliary code for parts 1 and 2, application-specific inputs and 
		general functions (partly inherited from https://github.com/andi-jo/ML_projection_toolbox).
		shapley_coeffs() calculates Shapley share coefficients (SSC).


Instructions
------------

	- Parts 1 and 2 are independent from each other.
	- Part 2b depends on 2a or on pre-computed results (SWP results are provided in
		ML_inf_joint_results_swp.pkl).
	- The "main_dir" variable needs to be set in both parts.
	- options can be set at the beginning of parts 1 and 2 (a and b).
	- Please consult the comments in the codes and docstrings for further documentation.
